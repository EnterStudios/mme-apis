<p>Acknowledge the DECIPHER Consortium; and</p>
<p>Contact the coordinator of the centre that entered the data on any individual who they wish to include in their report and offer appropriate agreed recognition of their contribution, which may include co-authorship if the magnitude of the contribution warrants it to at least one representative from the project/participating centre (possibly the member who submitted the patient data).
